What we know so far:
we saw sections 20 & 21,
We know what the objects / files of an open django project does.

We set a load for static files in the index of templates dir.

We know what view does (get data from model's and send the request to get response).
models contain fields of data, each obejct is row in a table database.

model is a class that fields will be table columns, model mapped to table i guess.

we created Todolist object to be migrated
then we do

# add the object as a migrational object
python manage.py makemigrations
# make this object to be related to be possbile to be added to db
# when an instance will exist?!
# make a table of such objects in the db
python manage.py migrate

I deide to understand the struture:
we have the django project which has manage.py and the objects of django procet,
within mylist dir (wsgi, asgi, etc).

Now, we also set a todolist dir, for the app, running on the django framework,
that we set?
